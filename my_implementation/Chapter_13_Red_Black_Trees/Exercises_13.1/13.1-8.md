### 13.1-8: Red Nodes in a Red-Black Tree

#### Problem Statement:
Argue that in a red-black tree, a red node cannot have exactly one non-NIL child.

### Argument:

To prove this statement, we need to rely on the properties of red-black trees, particularly focusing on property 4.

#### Red-Black Tree Properties Recap:
1. Every node is either red or black.
2. The root is black.
3. Every leaf (NIL) is black.
4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5. For each node, all paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.

### Analysis:

Let's consider a red node \( R \) in a red-black tree and assume it has exactly one non-NIL child. We will analyze the implications of this situation with respect to the properties of red-black trees.

#### Case 1: Red Node with One Black Child and One NIL Child
- Assume the red node \( R \) has one black child \( B \) and one NIL child.
  
This situation can be depicted as:
```
     R
    / \
   B  NIL
```

#### Violations:
1. **Property 4**: If a node is red, then both its children must be black. 
   - In this case, \( R \) has one black child \( B \), but the NIL child doesn't violate this property because NIL nodes are considered black.

2. **Property 5**: For each node, all paths from the node to descendant leaves must contain the same number of black nodes.
   - The path from \( R \) to the left subtree (via \( B \)) has a black height of 1 (only \( B \) is considered for black height).
   - The path from \( R \) to the right subtree (via NIL) has a black height of 0.
   - This difference in black heights violates property 5 of the red-black tree properties.

Due to the violation of property 5, it is impossible for a red node to have exactly one non-NIL child while maintaining the structure of a red-black tree.

#### Conclusion:
In a red-black tree, a red node cannot have exactly one non-NIL child. If it did, it would violate the properties of the red-black tree, specifically property 5, which requires that all paths from any node to its descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes. Hence, in a valid red-black tree, a red node must either have two black children or be a leaf node (with both children being NIL, implicitly black).
