### 13.1-5: Longest and Shortest Simple Paths in a Red-Black Tree

#### Problem Statement:
Show that the longest simple path from a node \( x \) in a red-black tree to a descendant leaf has a length at most twice that of the shortest simple path from node \( x \) to a descendant leaf.

### Proof:

To prove this, we will use the properties of red-black trees. 

#### Red-Black Tree Properties Recap:
1. Every node is either red or black.
2. The root is black.
3. Every leaf (NIL) is black.
4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5. For each node, all paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.

Let's denote the following:
- The black-height of a node \( x \) as \( bh(x) \), which is the number of black nodes from \( x \) to a leaf (including the leaf but excluding \( x \)).
- The length of the shortest path from \( x \) to a descendant leaf as \( s \).
- The length of the longest path from \( x \) to a descendant leaf as \( l \).

#### Shortest Path:
- The shortest path from \( x \) to a leaf includes only black nodes (since we are considering the minimum path in terms of node count).

Therefore:
\[ s = bh(x) \]

#### Longest Path:
- The longest path will alternate between red and black nodes (since we are considering the maximum path, including red nodes).

Since red nodes cannot have red children (property 4), the longest path will have a pattern like: black, red, black, red, ..., black (ending with a black leaf).

In the worst case, this path will have an equal number of black and red nodes, but the last node must be black. Therefore, for each black node, there is at most one red node in the path.

Hence:
\[ l \leq 2 \times bh(x) \]

#### Conclusion:
- Since \( s = bh(x) \) and \( l \leq 2 \times bh(x) \), it follows that:
\[ l \leq 2 \times s \]

Thus, the longest simple path from node \( x \) to a descendant leaf is at most twice the length of the shortest simple path from \( x \) to a descendant leaf.

### Summary:
We have shown that in a red-black tree, the length of the longest simple path from any node \( x \) to a descendant leaf is at most twice the length of the shortest simple path from \( x \) to a descendant leaf by leveraging the properties of the red-black tree, particularly the constraints on the arrangement of red and black nodes.
