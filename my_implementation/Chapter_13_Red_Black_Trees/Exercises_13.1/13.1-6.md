### 13.1-6: Number of Internal Nodes in a Red-Black Tree

#### Problem Statement:
What is the largest possible number of internal nodes in a red-black tree with black-height \( k \)? What is the smallest possible number?

### Definitions:
- **Black-height** (\( bh \)) of a node \( x \): The number of black nodes on any path from \( x \) to a leaf, not counting \( x \) itself.
- **Internal node**: A node that is not a leaf (NIL).

### Largest Possible Number of Internal Nodes:
To maximize the number of internal nodes in a red-black tree with black-height \( k \), we should make the tree as dense as possible. This means we need to alternate black and red nodes as much as possible.

1. **Structure**:
   - The black-height \( k \) means there are \( k \) black nodes from the root to any leaf.
   - To maximize internal nodes, we will place a red node as a child of every black node, except for the last black node in each path which will directly lead to NIL leaves.

2. **Calculation**:
   - At each black level, we can have 1 black node and up to 2 red children.
   - This results in a binary tree where each black node, except the last, has two red children, and each red node has black children.

The number of nodes at each level can be described as:
- Level 0: 1 black node (root)
- Level 1: 2 red nodes
- Level 2: 4 black nodes
- ...
- Level \( k-1 \): \( 2^{k-1} \) red nodes
- Level \( k \): \( 2^k \) black nodes (leaves)

The number of internal nodes \( n \) up to level \( k-1 \):
\[ n = 1 + 2 + 4 + \cdots + 2^{k-1} = 2^k - 1 \]

So, the largest possible number of internal nodes is:
\[ n_{\text{max}} = 2^k - 1 \]

### Smallest Possible Number of Internal Nodes:
To minimize the number of internal nodes, we should make the tree as sparse as possible.

1. **Structure**:
   - The black-height \( k \) means there are \( k \) black nodes from the root to any leaf.
   - A path can consist only of black nodes (no red nodes are added).

2. **Calculation**:
   - A single path from the root to a leaf with only black nodes will have \( k \) black nodes, and all nodes are internal except for the leaf.

Thus, the smallest possible number of internal nodes is:
\[ n_{\text{min}} = k - 1 \]

### Summary:
- **Largest possible number of internal nodes**: \( 2^k - 1 \)
- **Smallest possible number of internal nodes**: \( k - 1 \)

## Why the above solution is wrong?

- The largest is a path with half black nodes and half red nodes, which has $2^{2k} - 1$ internal nodes.
- The smallest is a path with all black nodes, which has $2^k - 1$ internal nodes.
