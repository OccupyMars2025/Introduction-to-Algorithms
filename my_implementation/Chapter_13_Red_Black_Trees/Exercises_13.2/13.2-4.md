To show that any arbitrary \( n \)-node binary search tree can be transformed into any other arbitrary \( n \)-node binary search tree using \( O(n) \) rotations, we will follow the hint provided and break the problem into two parts:

1. **Transforming the tree into a right-going chain (also known as a degenerate tree or vine) using at most \( n - 1 \) right rotations.**
2. **Transforming the right-going chain into the desired binary search tree using at most \( n - 1 \) left rotations.**

### Part 1: Transforming into a Right-Going Chain

1. **Initial Tree**:
    - We start with any arbitrary binary search tree (BST) with \( n \) nodes.

2. **Right Rotations**:
    - Perform right rotations at each node that has a left child. This operation will move the left child up and the current node down, transforming the left subtree into a right-going chain.

3. **Process**:
    - Start from the root and repeatedly perform right rotations on each node that has a left child until there are no left children left in the tree.
    - Each right rotation reduces the height of the left subtree and moves the current node down to its right child, gradually transforming the entire tree into a right-going chain.

4. **Number of Rotations**:
    - Since there are \( n - 1 \) edges in a tree, we need at most \( n - 1 \) right rotations to achieve a right-going chain.
    - Therefore, this part takes \( O(n) \) rotations.

### Part 2: Transforming the Right-Going Chain into the Desired Tree  (just the reverse process of Part 1)

1. **Right-Going Chain**:
    - Now we have a right-going chain where each node only has a right child.

2. **Left Rotations**:
    - Perform left rotations to transform the right-going chain into the desired binary search tree.
    - We will use the structure and properties of the desired tree to determine where each left rotation should be applied.

3. **Process**:
    - Starting from the bottom of the right-going chain, perform left rotations to rebuild the left children according to the structure of the desired tree.
    - Continue this process until the entire tree has been transformed into the desired binary search tree.

4. **Number of Rotations**:
    - Since there are \( n - 1 \) edges in the tree, we need at most \( n - 1 \) left rotations to transform the right-going chain into the desired binary search tree.
    - Therefore, this part also takes \( O(n) \) rotations.

### Conclusion

Combining both parts, we see that transforming an arbitrary \( n \)-node binary search tree into a right-going chain requires \( O(n) \) right rotations, and transforming a right-going chain into any desired \( n \)-node binary search tree requires \( O(n) \) left rotations. Thus, the total number of rotations needed is \( O(n) \).

This demonstrates that any arbitrary \( n \)-node binary search tree can be transformed into any other arbitrary \( n \)-node binary search tree using \( O(n) \) rotations.


## Note:
Let $r_1, r_2, \dots, r_k$ be the sequence of rotations required to convert some binary search tree $T_1$ into a right-going chain, and let $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$ be the sequence of rotations required to convert some other binary search tree $T_2$ to a right-going chain. Then $k < n$ and $m < n$, and we can convert $T_1$ to $T_2$ by performing the sequence $r_1, r_2, \dots, r_k, s_m', s_{m - 1}', \dots, s_1'$ where $s_i'$ is the opposite rotation of $s_i$. Since $k + m < 2n$, the number of rotations required is $O(n)$.


## Caution:
Before rotation, there are $p$ such edges $x -> x.left$, there are $m$ such edges $x -> x.right$, we know $p + m = n-1$. 
After one right rotation, the number of such edges $x -> x.left$ decreases by 1, and the number of such edges $x -> x.right$ increases by 1. Is this argument correct? I don't think so. These 2 numbers can be unchanged after a rotation. So you cannot do right rotation randomly, you should choose the appropriate node to do right rotation.
