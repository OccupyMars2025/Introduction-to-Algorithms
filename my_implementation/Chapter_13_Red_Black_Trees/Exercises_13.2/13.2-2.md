To address the problem stated in the image:

### Argument: Exactly \( n - 1 \) Possible Rotations in an \( n \)-Node Binary Search Tree

In a binary search tree (BST) with \( n \) nodes, each node except the root has exactly one parent. Rotations in a BST are local operations that involve only a parent node and one of its child nodes, specifically left or right rotations. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Definition of Rotations**:
    - **Left Rotation**: This involves a node \( x \) and its right child \( y \). The node \( y \) becomes the new parent of \( x \), and \( x \) becomes the left child of \( y \).
    - **Right Rotation**: This involves a node \( y \) and its left child \( x \). The node \( x \) becomes the new parent of \( y \), and \( y \) becomes the right child of \( x \).

2. **Total Possible Rotations**:
    - Each node (except the root) has exactly one parent.
    - Therefore, for \( n \) nodes, there are \( n - 1 \) parent-child relationships.
    - Each parent-child relationship can be involved in exactly one rotation: if the parent has a left child, a right rotation is possible; if the parent has a right child, a left rotation is possible.

3. **No Overlap in Rotations**:(I doubt it !)
    - Each rotation operation affects only one specific parent-child pair.
    - There are no nodes that can be involved in more than one rotation at the same time.

Thus, for an \( n \)-node binary search tree, there are exactly \( n - 1 \) possible rotations, each corresponding to one of the \( n - 1 \) edges (or parent-child relationships) in the tree.
