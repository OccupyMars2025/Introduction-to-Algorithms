### Exercise 13.3-1: Why Not Set \( z \)'s Color to Black?

The exercise asks why the newly inserted node \( z \) is set to red in the red-black tree insertion algorithm instead of black. Let's analyze this by considering the properties of red-black trees:

#### Red-Black Tree Properties:

1. Every node is either red or black.
2. The root is black.
3. Every leaf (NIL) is black.
4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.

#### Explanation:

1. **Maintaining Property 5 (Black-Height Property)**:
   - If we insert a new node \( z \) and set it to black, it will increase the black-height of all paths that pass through \( z \) by 1. This would violate property 5 because it would create paths with different black-heights.
   - By inserting \( z \) as red, we do not change the black-height of any path, ensuring that property 5 remains satisfied.

2. **Maintaining Property 4 (Red-Node Property)**:
   - If the parent of \( z \) (let's call it \( p \)) is black, setting \( z \) to red maintains property 4 because a red node can have a black parent.
   - If \( p \) is red, setting \( z \) to red violates property 4 temporarily, but this can be corrected in the `RB-INSERT-FIXUP` procedure by performing rotations and recoloring.

3. **Insertion and Fix-Up**:
   - The insertion algorithm assumes that the new node \( z \) starts as red. If we inserted \( z \) as black, we would skip the color violations that the fix-up procedure is designed to handle.
   - Setting \( z \) as red simplifies the insertion process because it only requires adjusting for potential violations when the parent is also red.

By inserting \( z \) as red, we avoid immediately violating the black-height property and allow the fix-up procedure to address any temporary violations of the red-node property. This approach ensures that the red-black tree properties are preserved efficiently.

### Conclusion:

Setting the newly inserted node \( z \) to red ensures that the overall structure of the red-black tree remains balanced by maintaining the black-height of all paths. The fix-up procedure can then correct any red-node property violations, ensuring that the tree remains balanced and retains its properties. This design choice simplifies the algorithm and ensures the correctness of the red-black tree.
