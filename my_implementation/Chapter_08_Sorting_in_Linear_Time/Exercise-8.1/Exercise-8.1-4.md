To show that an \( \Omega(n \log n) \) lower bound still holds for comparison-based sorting in this scenario, we can argue using the information-theoretic framework and decision-tree analysis of sorting. Here's the reasoning step by step:

---

### Step 1: Key Property of Comparison-Based Sorting
For any comparison-based sorting algorithm, the time complexity lower bound is determined by the number of permutations of the input that the algorithm can distinguish. If there are \( P(n) \) possible input permutations, the decision tree representing the algorithm must have at least \( \log_2 P(n) \) height in the worst case. This gives the lower bound \( \Omega(\log_2 P(n)) \) for the number of comparisons.

For a general unsorted sequence of \( n \) elements, there are \( n! \) possible permutations, leading to a lower bound of \( \Omega(n \log n) \).

---

### Step 2: Analyze Permutations in the Partially Sorted Input
In the given problem, the sequence is partially sorted such that for elements in positions \( i \) where \( i \mod 4 = 0 \), each element can only occupy one of three positions: its current position, one position before, or one position after. For the other elements (where \( i \mod 4 \neq 0 \)), no restrictions are given.

#### Case 1: Elements with \( i \mod 4 = 0 \)
There are \( \frac{n}{4} \) such positions. Each element in this subset has three possible positions, leading to \( 3^{n/4} \) arrangements of these elements.

#### Case 2: Elements with \( i \mod 4 \neq 0 \)
There are \( \frac{3n}{4} \) such positions. These elements are unrestricted, leading to \( (\frac{3n}{4})! \) possible arrangements.

The total number of permutations of the input sequence is therefore:

\[
P(n) = 3^{n/4} \cdot (\frac{3n}{4})!
\]

---

### Step 3: Lower Bound on Comparisons
The lower bound on the number of comparisons is given by \( \log_2 P(n) \):

\[
\log_2 P(n) = \log_2 \left( 3^{n/4} \cdot (\frac{3n}{4})! \right) 
= \log_2(3^{n/4}) + \log_2((\frac{3n}{4})!)
\]

#### Simplify the Terms
1. **For \( \log_2(3^{n/4}) \):**
\[
\log_2(3^{n/4}) = \frac{n}{4} \log_2 3
\]
This term grows linearly with \( n \), which is negligible compared to the next term.

2. **For \( \log_2((\frac{3n}{4})!) \):**
Using Stirling's approximation, \( k! \sim \sqrt{2 \pi k} \left(\frac{k}{e}\right)^k \), we have:
\[
\log_2((\frac{3n}{4})!) \sim \log_2 \left( \sqrt{2 \pi (\frac{3n}{4})} \cdot \left(\frac{3n}{4e}\right)^{3n/4} \right)
\]
\[
\sim \frac{3n}{4} \log_2(\frac{3n}{4}) - \frac{3n}{4} \log_2 e + \frac{1}{2} \log_2(2 \pi (\frac{3n}{4}))
\]
The dominant term here is \( \frac{3n}{4} \log_2(\frac{3n}{4}) \), which grows as \( \Omega(n \log n) \).

---

### Step 4: Conclusion
The total number of comparisons is dominated by the term \( \log_2((\frac{3n}{4})!) \), which gives a lower bound of \( \Omega(n \log n) \). Thus, even with the restriction on elements where \( i \mod 4 = 0 \), the \( \Omega(n \log n) \) lower bound for comparison-based sorting still applies.
