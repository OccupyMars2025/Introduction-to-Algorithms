To handle the case where each node \( x \) in a binary search tree keeps a pointer to its successor \( x.succ \) instead of its parent \( x.p \), we need to provide pseudocode for `TREE-SEARCH`, `TREE-INSERT`, and `TREE-DELETE` operations. These operations should operate in \( O(h) \) time, where \( h \) is the height of the tree. We assume all keys in the binary search tree are distinct.

### Helper Function: Finding the Parent of a Node

We first define a helper function to find the parent of a given node \( x \). This function is necessary since the nodes do not maintain parent pointers.

```python
def TREE-PARENT(T, x):
    if x == T.root:
        return NIL
    current = T.root
    parent = NIL
    while current != NIL and current != x:
        parent = current
        if x.key < current.key:
            current = current.left
        else:
            current = current.right
    return parent
```

### TREE-SEARCH

```python
def TREE-SEARCH(T, x, k):
    if x == NIL or k == x.key:
        return x
    if k < x.key:
        return TREE-SEARCH(T, x.left, k)
    else:
        return TREE-SEARCH(T, x.right, k)
```

### TREE-INSERT

```python
def TREE-INSERT(T, z):
    """
    We assume that z.left, z.right, and z.succ are already set to NIL.
    """
    y_pred = NIL
    y = NIL
    x = T.root
    while x != NIL:
        y = x
        if z.key < x.key:
            x = x.left
        else:
            y_pred = x
            x = x.right

    if y == NIL:
        T.root = z
        return 
    elif z.key < y.key:
        y.left = z
        z.succ = y
        if y_pred != NIL:
            y_pred.succ = z
    else:
        y.right = z
        z.succ = y.succ
        y.succ = z
```

### TREE-DELETE

```python
def TREE-DELETE(T, z):
    if z.left == NIL:
        TRANSPLANT(T, z, z.right)
    elif z.right == NIL:
        TRANSPLANT(T, z, z.left)
    else:
        y = TREE-MINIMUM(z.right)
        if TREE-PARENT(T, y) != z:
            TRANSPLANT(T, y, y.right)
            y.right = z.right
        TRANSPLANT(T, z, y)
        y.left = z.left
        y.succ = z.succ
```

### TRANSPLANT

```python
def TRANSPLANT(T, u, v):
    u_parent = TREE-PARENT(T, u)
    if u_parent == NIL:
        T.root = v
    elif u == u_parent.left:
        u_parent.left = v
    else:
        u_parent.right = v
    if v != NIL:
        v.succ = u.succ
```

### TREE-MINIMUM

```python
def TREE-MINIMUM(x):
    while x.left != NIL:
        x = x.left
    return x
```

### Explanation

- **TREE-PARENT**: This function traverses the tree from the root to find and return the parent of a given node \( x \).
- **TREE-SEARCH**: This is a standard binary search tree search operation that returns the node containing the key \( k \).
- **TREE-INSERT**: This function inserts a new node \( z \) into the tree while updating the successor pointers. It finds the correct position for \( z \) and adjusts the `succ` pointers accordingly.
- **TREE-DELETE**: This function deletes the node \( z \) from the tree. It handles three cases: \( z \) has no left child, \( z \) has no right child, and \( z \) has two children. It uses the `TRANSPLANT` function to replace \( z \) with its successor and adjusts the `succ` pointers.
- **TRANSPLANT**: This function replaces the subtree rooted at node \( u \) with the subtree rooted at node \( v \). It correctly updates the parent pointers and the `succ` pointers.
- **TREE-MINIMUM**: This function returns the node with the minimum key in the subtree rooted at \( x \).

These pseudocode snippets provide a complete implementation of `TREE-SEARCH`, `TREE-INSERT`, and `TREE-DELETE` operations for a binary search tree that maintains successor pointers instead of parent pointers.
