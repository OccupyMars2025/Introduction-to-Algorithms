### Analyzing the Time Complexity of Sorting Using a Binary Search Tree (BST)

When sorting a set of \( n \) numbers by first building a binary search tree (BST) and then performing an inorder traversal, the time complexity depends on the structure of the BST.

#### Best-Case Scenario

In the best-case scenario, the BST is balanced. This means that the height of the tree is \( O(\log n) \).

- **Insertion Time:** Inserting a single element into a balanced BST takes \( O(\log n) \) time. Since there are \( n \) elements, the total time for insertion is \( O(n \log n) \).
- **Inorder Traversal Time:** An inorder traversal of a BST, regardless of its shape, takes \( O(n) \) time.

Thus, the total time complexity in the best-case scenario is:
\[ O(n \log n) \]

#### Worst-Case Scenario

In the worst-case scenario, the BST is completely unbalanced, resembling a linked list. This can happen if the elements are inserted in sorted order.

- **Insertion Time:** Inserting a single element into an unbalanced BST takes \( O(n) \) time in the worst case. Since there are \( n \) elements, the total time for insertion is \( O(n^2) \).
- **Inorder Traversal Time:** As in the best-case scenario, an inorder traversal of a BST takes \( O(n) \) time.

Thus, the total time complexity in the worst-case scenario is:
\[ O(n^2) \]

### Summary

- **Best-Case Running Time:** \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Worst-Case Running Time:** \( O(n^2) \)

The best-case scenario occurs when the BST is balanced, while the worst-case scenario occurs when the BST is completely unbalanced.
