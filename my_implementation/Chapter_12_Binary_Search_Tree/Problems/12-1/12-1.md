Let's address the questions in the problem statement regarding inserting \( n \) items with identical keys into an initially empty binary search tree using various strategies.

### Part (a): Asymptotic Performance of TREE-INSERT for Identical Keys

When all keys are identical, each insertion of a new item will result in the new item being inserted as either a left or right child of the previously inserted item. The tree will effectively become a linked list.

- **Performance**: Each insertion takes \( O(1) \) time to compare keys, but to find the correct insertion point, it takes \( O(i) \) time for the \( i \)-th insertion. Summing over all \( n \) insertions, the total time is:
\[ O(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n) = O\left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right) = O(n^2) \]

### Part (b): Using a Boolean Flag

In this strategy, a boolean flag \( x.b \) at node \( x \) is used to determine whether the new node should be inserted as the left or right child, alternating each time.

This strategy will result in each of the two children subtrees having a difference in size at most one. This means that the height will be $\Theta(\log n)$ . So, the total runtime will be $\sum_{i = 1}^n \log i \in \Theta(n\log n)$.

### Part (c): Keeping a List of Nodes with Equal Keys

This will only take linear time since the tree itself will be of height 0, and a single insertion into a list can be done in constant time.

### Part (d): Randomly Setting \( x \) to Either \( x.left \) or \( x.right \)

In this strategy, the insertion point is chosen randomly between the left and right child nodes.

- **Performance**: Each insertion point is chosen randomly, so on average, the tree will remain balanced.
- **Worst-case Performance**: In the worst case, the tree could still become highly unbalanced, resembling a linked list, resulting in \( \Theta (n^2) \) time.
- **Expected Running Time**: The expected depth of the tree is \( \Theta(\log i) \), making each insertion take \( \Theta(\log i) \) time on average. Thus, the expected total time is:
\[ \Theta(n \log n) \]
