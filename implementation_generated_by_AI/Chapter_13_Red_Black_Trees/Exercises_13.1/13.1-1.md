To solve this problem, we need to draw the complete binary search tree of height 3 for the keys \{1, 2, ..., 15\}, and then color the nodes such that the black-heights of the resulting red-black trees are 2, 3, and 4.

### Step 1: Draw the Complete Binary Search Tree

A complete binary search tree of height 3 with 15 nodes looks like this:

```
              8
           /     \
         4         12
       /   \      /    \
     2      6  10     14
    / \    / \  / \   /  \
   1   3  5  7 9  11 13  15
```

### Step 2: Add NIL Leaves

Each node that doesn't have a child will have a NIL leaf. This means each leaf node (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15) will have two NIL leaves.

### Step 3: Color the Nodes

We need to color the nodes such that the black-heights of the resulting red-black trees are 2, 3, and 4. 

#### Black-Height 2

For a black-height of 2, we can color the tree as follows:
- Root (black)
- Children of the root (red)
- Grandchildren (black)

```
              8 (B)
           /         \
        4 (R)       12 (R)
       /   \       /     \
    2 (B)  6 (B)  10 (B) 14 (B)
   / \     / \    / \     / \
  1(R) 3(R)5(R)7(R)9(R)11(R)13(R)15(R)
```

#### Black-Height 3

For a black-height of 3, we can color the tree as follows:
- Root (black)
- Children of the root (black)
- Grandchildren (red)
- Great-grandchildren (black)

```
              8 (B)
           /         \
        4 (B)       12 (B)
       /   \       /     \
    2 (R)  6 (R)  10 (R) 14 (R)
   / \     / \    / \     / \
  1(B) 3(B)5(B)7(B)9(B)11(B)13(B)15(B)
```

#### Black-Height 4

For a black-height of 4, we can color the tree as follows:
- Root (black)
- Children of the root (black)
- Grandchildren (black)
- Great-grandchildren (red)
- Great-great-grandchildren (black, which are the NIL nodes)

```
              8 (B)
           /         \
        4 (B)       12 (B)
       /   \       /     \
    2 (B)  6 (B)  10 (B) 14 (B)
   / \     / \    / \     / \
  1(B) 3(B)5(B)7(B)9(B)11(B)13(B)15(B)
```

Here, each leaf node has two NIL children which are also black.

These three trees represent different valid red-black tree configurations with black-heights of 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
