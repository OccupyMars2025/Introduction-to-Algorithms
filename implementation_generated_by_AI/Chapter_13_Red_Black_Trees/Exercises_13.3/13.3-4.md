> Professor Teach is concerned that $\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ might set $T.nil.color$ to $\text{RED}$, in which case the test in line 1 would not cause the loop to terminate when $z$ is the root. Show that the professor's concern is unfounded by arguing that $\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ never sets $T.nil.color$ to $\text{RED}$.

First observe that $\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ only modifies the child of a node if it is already $\text{RED}$, so we will never modify a child which is set to $T.nil$. We just need to check that the parent of the root is never set to $\text{RED}$.

Since the root and the parent of the root are automatically black, if $z$ is at depth less than $2$, the **while** loop will be broken. We only modify colors of nodes at most two levels above $z$, so the only case we need to worry about is when $z$ is at depth $2$. In this case we risk modifying the root to be $\text{RED}$, but this is handled in line 16. When $z$ is updated, it will be either the root or the child of the root. Either way, the root and the parent of the root are still $\text{BLACK}$, so the **while** condition is violated, making it impossibly to modify $T.nil$ to be $\text{RED}$.
