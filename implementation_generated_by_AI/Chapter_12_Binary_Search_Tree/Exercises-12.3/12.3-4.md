The provided image illustrates the different scenarios when deleting a node \( z \) from a binary search tree (BST) and highlights the use of the `TRANSPLANT` procedure. Here's a detailed explanation based on the scenarios shown:

### Scenarios of TREE-DELETE and Use of TRANSPLANT

#### (a) Node \( z \) has no left child
- **Description**: If the node \( z \) to be deleted has no left child, we replace \( z \) with its right child \( r \). The right child \( r \) can be `NIL`.
- **TRANSPLANT Call**: `TRANSPLANT(T, z, z.right)`
- **Circumstance for NIL**: If \( z.right \) is `NIL`, then \( v \) in the `TRANSPLANT` procedure is `NIL`.


#### (d) Node \( z \) has two children, \( y.parent \) is not \( z \)
- **Description**: If the node \( z \) to be deleted has two children, we need to find its successor \( y \), which is the smallest node in \( z \)'s right subtree. In this case, \( y \) has no left child. We perform two transplants:
  1. Replace \( y \) with its right child \( x \) (which could be `NIL`).
  2. Replace \( z \) with \( y \).
- **TRANSPLANT Calls**:
  1. `TRANSPLANT(T, y, y.right)`
  2. `TRANSPLANT(T, z, y)`
- **Circumstance for NIL**: In the first transplant call, if \( y.right \) is `NIL`, then \( v \) in the `TRANSPLANT` procedure is `NIL`.
