intuition: lenght of rod = 4
p[3] has the highest density, so we cut the rod into two pieces of length 3 and 1. 
but the density of p[3] is only a little higher than p[2], so we can cut the rod into two pieces of length 2 and 2, which is better than the previous one.
p[1] = 0.1
p[2] = 9 * 2
p[3] = 10 * 3
p[4] = 0.1 * 4
